# PDE 4446 Course Work 2: OpenCV Git Repo and Demo

## Introduction
The project here is to detect a red ball given and align it to the center of the screen. Basically this is a coursework which uses object detection using OpenCV. The course work is done step by step. 

## Step 1: Find Out the HSV Values of the Ball
I created a code in Python that allows us to create a slider box which adjusts the HSV values of the camera screen by ourselves. By sliding each of the Lower and higher HSV we will isolate the colour RED where the screen only detects red objects. The HSV can vary depending on the lighting condition of the room.
